This is a classic phrase hunter game.
The user has to guess the letters to find out what the phrase is made of.
This can be done by 'clicking' the keybuttons or simply using the keyboard.

Extra css styling:
- changed the .start background styling to a funky color.
- changed the .title and gave it a old school shadow.
= changed background and color of start button.
